## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## Running the Application

To start the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

---

## Building the Application

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command creates an optimized version of the application in the `dist` folder.

---

## Previewing the Application

## Session Management

To ensure security and a smooth user experience, the application implements a robust session management system. A user's session can be removed under the following conditions:

1. **User Logs Out:** When the user manually logs out, their session is removed.
2. **Inactivity for 15 Minutes:** If the user remains inactive for 15 minutes, their session will automatically be removed. This is handled using the `react-idle-timer` library with the following configuration:
   ```javascript
   useIdleTimer({
     onIdle,               // Callback function triggered when user is idle
     timeout: 900000,       // 15 minutes in milliseconds
     throttle: 500,        // Frequency to check user activity in milliseconds
   });
   ```
   - **`timeout`:** This defines the duration of inactivity (in milliseconds) after which the user is considered idle. In our case, itâ€™s set to 15 minutes.
   - **`throttle`:** This determines how often the application checks for user activity. A lower value results in more frequent checks.
3. **Session Duration of 8 Hours:** Sessions are designed to automatically expire after 8 hours. This is because the authentication token used to maintain the session expires after this duration. Once expired, the session will be removed.

**Note:** In all these scenarios, the application ensures the user's session is securely removed, and they are redirected to the login page.
